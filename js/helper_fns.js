/*
Takes a colour string and returns the next color. First Colour is #000000
Colors in specific precisions are equally spaced, and precision increases by a constant factor after iterating over all colours of lower precisions.

E.g. If this function was nextNumber, and returned a number in [0,1], the series would be 
0,0.5,  0.25,0.75,  0.125,0.375,0.625,0.875, ...
or 
0/2,1/2,  1/4,3/4, 1/8,3/8,5/8,7/8, 1/16,3/16... 
so getting calling nextNumber 16 times would result in 16 equally spaced numbers
